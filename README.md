# Robot Execution Catalog (REC)

REC is a tool that aims to make data in robot executions [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). 
It is designed to configure, manage, organize and consolidate (meta)data used or generated by robots executing tasks or tests.


## Acknowledgments

This tool is inspired by [sacred](https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred/tree/master), a tool to organize experiments for Machine Learning. We borrow small pieces of code under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/MIT), but have rewritten and simplified the framework for robotics.
